# Amazon Product Finder

## About
This is a simple project developed using `puppeteer`, `nodeJS`, `expressJS`, `HTML` and `CSS`. 
Aim of the project is to let user enter any product they want in our search bar, on submitting which will initiate the scraping action on [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com) using puppeteer service. 
Service will search the product using given query, then take the first product from the results list and store the productâ€™s necessary information(screenshot of product page 
and HTML content) in the local device storage. Additionally, user will be able to see the product itemâ€™s title, price and URL, which will navigate them to the actual amazon product site.

## Setting Up Project:-
-	First, make sure you have the latest node version installed on your system and a code editor(like VSCode, Atom etc.)
-	Then, clone this repository in your local system, or clone it using the CLI. There are multiple ways to clone the repo as shown in the image below.

-	Next, open the terminal and move to the root directory of the project folder using- <br>
 `cd <project_directory_path>` <br>
 and run, <br>
`npm init` <br>
to initialize a new Node.js project and install the required dependencies.
-	Install all the important dependencies which weâ€™ll be using in this project- 
```
npm i puppeteer
npm i express
npm i fs
```
-	Finally, run- <br>
`node app.js`
This will start the session on port- 3000.
-	Open `localhost:3000` in your browser, and the requested webpage (app.html) will be rendered and ready for interaction with user.
- Use the search bar to enter the product you want.
Here, I have searched â€˜office chairâ€™, and as you can see, our scraping with puppeteer is in progress now.

## Tech Stack 

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Backend:** Node, Express

## Future Scope:-
-	UI could be improved to include multiple products, along with a product image, clicking which will redirect them to product URL.
-	Search experience could be improved to generate product recommendations, based on what user is typing.
-	Scope of scraping could be increased to study vast product data, for the purpose of data science.
